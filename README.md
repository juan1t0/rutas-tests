# Initial tests of emotion recognition method on Pepper robot

This repository involves the implementation of a [previous work](https://github.com/juan1t0/multimodalDLforER.git) in the robotic context, specifically working with a Pepper robot.
The presented implementation consists of an out-robot emotion system. The whole deep-learning procedures run in a server while the robot executes determined actions according to the emotions recognised.


## run

This project use python scripts of two versions, 2.7 and 3.9, because the communication with robot needs the NAOqi framawork, which work only with python 2.7.
To run this project, call the script ` pp3p.py`
